SDLC
The software development lifecycle (SDLC) is a framework that development teams use to produce high-quality software in a systematic and cost-effective way. Both large and small software organizations use the SDLC methodology. These teams follow development models ranging from agile to lean to waterfall and others.

The software development lifecycle gives organizations a systematic, step-by-step approach to developing successful software from gathering the initial requirements for a new product. Weâ€™ll teach you how to employ SDLC by maintaining a mature product on the market.
